# Weather App
The project is a weather application that displays the current weather of the user's location by default. It also allows the user to add cities to a list by searching for them and saves them to the application's settings. Users can switch the language of the application to English, Ukrainian, or Russian. Additionally, the application uses the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch temperature and date data for a specific city. This data is then used to create a graph that shows the temperature.
